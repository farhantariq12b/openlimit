//! An open source Rust high performance cryptocurrency trading API with support for multiple exchanges and language wrappers.
//! Focused in safety, correctness and speed.
//!
//!## Project goals
//!
//!This is an ambitious project that seeks to create a new industry standard API implementation for secure,
//! correct and high performance cryptocurrency trading.
//! It is initially focused on spot exchanges as a method to define how initial data structures and project architecture
//! should be to allow zero cost abstractions
//! around the exchanges' peculiarities. So initial project goals are:
//!
//!* Based on Rust, memory safe by default.
//!* Support for websockets and user defined networking.
//!* Thin layer wrappers for Java, C#, Python and Node.js
//!* Easy to add support for additional exchanges.
//!* Open-source only, now and forever.
//!
//!Future goals are:
//!
//!* Support for futures trading
//!* Support for options trading
//!* WASM compilation allowing it to be embedded in static web pages
//!
//! **Warning**: the project is still in development and a lot of breaking changes are being made.
//!
//! ### Community
//!
//!There is a project slack, [click here](https://join.slack.com/t/openlimitsworkspace/shared_invite/zt-ifhd5tv4-9QL73tCB~fDcRJzDFEuOrQ) to join.
//!
//!### Testing
//!
//!In order to run the tests you will have to provide environment variables for the sandbox API of the exchanges,
//! you can use environment variables or use a `.env` file.
//!
//!### Sponsorship
//!
//!We invite industry participants to join us in sponsoring a new high quality open source standard for crypto trading APIs. [
//! Nash](https://nash.io) is dedicating a maintainer and initial rewards for external contributors that close issues.
//! Look for the wiki [rewards table](https://github.com/nash-io/openlimits/wiki/Rewards-sizes) and for reward size labels on open issues.
